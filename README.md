# FEMA National Risk Index Visualization

This repository contains my work for HW2 in EDS 240 (Data Visualization). The goal of this assignment is to explore the FEMA National Risk Index (NRI) dataset and create a visualization that compares California counties to counties in other U.S. states across FEMA’s composite risk categories.


## Repository Purpose
This repo houses:

- The Quarto document (hw2.qmd) containing code, analysis, and the final visualization
- A data folder with the FEMA NRI dataset used in the assignment (not included in this repo)
- The project demonstrates basic data cleaning, risk analysis comparisons, and ridge plot visualization in R.
